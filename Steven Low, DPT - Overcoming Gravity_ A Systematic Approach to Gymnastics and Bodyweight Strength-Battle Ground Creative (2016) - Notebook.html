    A lack of strength will always limit you in other domains—technique, endurance, skill, balance, flexibility—both active and passive—agility, coordination, etc. You must be strong in order to excel in all of these other domains. The converse is typically not true. It is important to keep this in mind as you set your goals.

    Intensity can be modified by increasing the difficulty of an exercise according to the amount of repetitions you can perform. This can be done through increasing the progression, utilizing a weight vest, or other methods. Volume can be modified in three different ways: The amount of repetitions per set. The amount of sets per exercise performed. The total amount of exercises performed.

    This process of adding weight to the lifts with each new workout—usually five or ten pounds per lift—forces constant adaptations with every workout, so that both strength and muscle mass can be drastically increased.

    A preparatory phase tends to be a slow increase in volume and intensity coming up from an off week. It was basically a “ramp in” for a serious workout directly after a deload week. A hypertrophy phase tends to range in about 60-85% 1 RM (about 5-12 repetitions). A strength phase tends to range around about 80-100% 1 RM (about 1-8 repetitions). A power phase tends to utilize lighter weights around 40-60% 1 RM (about 3-6 repetitions) and focuses on pure acceleration.

    Skill Work depends on the intensity of the skills. As stated before, handstands may be strength work for beginners at first and thus may be a part of the actual workout. However, once balance becomes the priority of training and strength becomes less of an issue, it can be trained more frequently. Skill work that is focused on balance can be trained every day. Isometrics are not always skill work as planche, back lever, and front lever are never about balance, but training strength.

    Workout Factors–These are generally performed two to four times per week because there needs to be significant recovery between each session due to high intensity, training to failure, or other high volume work. Variation beyond this frequency on a weekly basis is typically reserved for those who have significant experience designing exercise programs. Recovery and Optimization Factors–These can be performed three to infinite times per week. These factors are aimed at facilitating recovery of the body through movement, soft tissue work, or low-intensity exercise that gets the blood flowing. Most of what falls into this category should leave you feeling significantly better than when you started, and will not impair workout sessions performed later in the day or the day after. This includes lighter-intensity flexibility work, recovery jogs and walks, mobility work, light skill work, and the like. Rehabilitation Factors–Rehabilitation and prehabilitation factors are specific. The main thing to understand about these is that rehabilitation is not always focused on increasing strength, though that can be a part of it. Typically, when a tissue is injured you will want to go through a phase where you begin with low-intensity workouts and build up to higher intensity workouts.

<div class="noteText">
    Hybrid sets combine the effectiveness of practicing the next progression with the volume of the previous progression, focusing on both strength and hypertrophy at the same time in the same set. If you ever find yourself stalled on any inter-exercise progressions, utilize bodyweight drop sets to help bridge the gap.

    If you are training a specific attribute such as hypertrophy, your routine will follow a predictable pattern. Generally, your intensity will be moderate (60-85% 1 RM), your sets and repetitions volume will be relatively high (4-6 + sets of 8-12 repetitions), your rest times will be moderate (2-4 minutes), and your tempo may be longer, with pauses (51 × 1).

    If you are training a specific attribute such as strength, your routine will also follow a predictable pattern. Your intensity will be higher (80-100% 1 RM), your sets and repetitions volume will be relatively lower (3-8 + sets of 1-6 repetitions), your rest times will be higher (3-5 + minutes), and your tempo will be shorter (10 × 0). Did you notice any similarity to an intensification phase?

    Concurrent periodization tends to be most effective working in “blocks”—you cycle exercises in and out of the routine during the mesocycle and provide deloads within the mesocycle to progress.

    Linear Progression: Add weight to each workout. Linear Repetition Progression: Add repetitions to all sets of the exercise. Repetition Addition: Add repetitions to single or multiple sets of an exercise.
